## Compatibility

Application tested on Windows 10 and expected to work properly on Windows 7 and higher.

I would also appreciate feedback from Vista and XP users (problems with startup folder path expected). Feel free to create Issues and Pull Requests.

## Build

To build application simply run `Build.bat`.

Build requires .NET Framework 4.0.

## Adding to Startup

Run `Add to Startup folder.bat` to put compiled exe file to your Startup folder. 

Application doesn't use timers or any complexed logic that might slow down your performance.
